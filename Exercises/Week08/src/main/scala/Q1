a) The strategy pattern is the encapsulation of different algorithms that differ in their behaviour but solve the same
problem. The algorithms can be used interchangeably depending on the context. This allows the specific implementation
to be chosen at run time and can vary independently from the clients that use it - each different strategy uses the
same interface therefore decoupling the implementation from the clients.

b) The strategy pattern should be used when there are different ways to perform the same task and you do not know
in advance which way will be used. So the specific strategy can be chosen at runtime.
