It is appropriate to use the abstract factory pattern when you have a family of products that have a common theme but
you do not wish to specify the concrete types to the client. The abstract factory provides an abstract pointer to the
factory that will create the concrete object. This separates client code from object creation as they are only
aware of the abstract type, thus meaning less modification to client code to add new concrete types.
