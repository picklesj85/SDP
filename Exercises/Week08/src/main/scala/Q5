When an object is complex and can have many different composite parts this can lead to exponential increase of possible
constructors. Rather than try and deal with all possible combinations of the composition within the constructors, you
can take a more modular approach and use another 'builder' class that specifies which parts are to be added step by
step and then returns the constructed object as a whole. This allows different modules to be added without increasing
complexity oin the constructor of the object.
