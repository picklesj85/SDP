The bridge pattern creates two layers of abstraction and so allows the concrete classes to vary independently
from the abstractions. A succinct example of this is different coloured shapes. Rather than have an abstract class
'Shape' and then multiple different classes extending this with different colours (e.g. 'RedCircle', 'GreenCircle',
'RedSquare', 'GreenSquare' etc) it makes sense to also have an abstract class colour and use composition to allow
for any combination of shape and colour - thus the concrete classes can vary independently.
